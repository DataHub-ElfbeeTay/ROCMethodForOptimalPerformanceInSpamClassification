# ROCMethodForOptimalPerformanceInSpamClassification
*This project evaluated four different email classifier algorithms (Na√Øve Bayes, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and K-nearest Neighbors) based on the Receiver Operating Curve - Area under the Curve (ROC-AUC) as a performance measure. which has been widely used in the machine learning field compared to the accuracy metrics used generally in assessing performance measure of the classification algorithm. 
*The research found that plotting the R0C-AUC curve to determine the appropriate threshold is a better approach to using the community norms of the 0.5 accuracy threshold. 
*This research was published as a book section in the Handbook of Intelligent Computing and Optimization for Sustainable Development, Wiley Online Library (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119792642.ch16).
